FileSearch :
Create a java program to search through the home directory and look for files that match a regular expression. The program should be able to take inputs repeatedly and should print out the full absolute path of the matching files found.



CheckUnique :
Write a java function that checks if the input string contains all the letters of the alphabet a-z (case-insensitive). Write time and space complexity of your solution as comments in the source file




Ping_Median
Write a java function that will ping any host ( given as input ) and computes the median of the time taken to ping.
Use the system ping utility, do not use any deprecated methods.




Error Handling(Java_Assignment_8)
Create three new types of exceptions. Write a class with a method that throws all three. In main( ), call the method but only use a single catch clause that will catch all three types of exceptions. Add a finally clause and verify that your finally clause is executed, even if a NullPointerException is thrown.




I/O(Java_Assignment_11)
Using TextFile and a Map<Character,Integer>, create a program that takes the file name as a command line argument and counts the occurrence of all the different characters. Save the results in a text file.




(java_Assignment_9)
Using the documentation for java.util.regex.Pattern as a resource, write and test a regular expression that checks a sentence to see that it begins with a capital letter and ends with a period.




Operators and More:(java assignment 6)
1. A vampire number v is a number with an even number of digits n, that can be factored into two numbers x and y each with n/2 digits and not both with trailing zeroes, where v contains precisely all the digits from x and from y, in any order. Write a java program to print first 100 vampire numbers.

2. Create a class with two (overloaded) constructors. Using this, call the second constructor inside the first one.

3. Create a class with a constructor that takes a String argument. During construction, print the argument. Create an array of object references to this class, but donâ€™t actually create objects to assign into the array. When you run the program, notice whether the initialization messages from the constructor calls are printed.

4. Complete the previous exercise by creating objects to attach to the array of references.

Access Control and More

1. Create an inheritance hierarchy of Rodent: Mouse, Gerbil, Hamster,etc. In the base class, provide methods that are common to all Rodents, and override these in the derived classes to perform different behaviors depending on the specific type of Rodent. Create an array of Rodent, fill it with different specific types of Rodents, and call your base-class methods to see what happens. Make the methods of Rodent abstract whenever possible and all classes should have default constructors that print a message about that class.

2. Create a Cycle class, with subclasses Unicycle, Bicycle and Tricycle. Add a balance( ) method to Unicycle and Bicycle, but not to Tricycle. Create instances of all three types and upcast them to an array of Cycle. Try to call balance( ) on each element of the array and observe the results. Downcast and call balance( ) and observe what happens.

3. Create three interfaces, each with two methods. Inherit a new interface that combines the three, adding a new method. Create a class by implementing the new interface and also inheriting from a concrete class. Now write four methods, each of which takes one of the four interfaces as an argument. In main( ), create an object of your class and pass it to each of the methods.

4. Create a Cycle interface, with implementations Unicycle, Bicycle and Tricycle. Create factories for each type of Cycle, and code that uses these factories.

5. Create a class with an inner class that has a non-default constructor (one that takes arguments). Create a second class with an inner class that inherits from the first inner class.
